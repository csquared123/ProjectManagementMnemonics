### PMBOK 6 Process Groups and Knowledge Areas Matrix

This first section has some strategies to remember the row and column names and the general shape of the matrix.

| Mnemonic | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Initiated Projects Eventually Must Close. | (Column Names) Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitor & Control, Closing |
| Project managers who Integrate Scale, Schedule, Cost, and Quality Human Communication Risk Procuring Stakeholders | (Row Names) Integrate, Scale, Schedule, Cost, Quality, (Human) Resources, Communication, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholders |
| 5 x 10 = 50 (adjust to 49) | There are 49 processes. 5 x 10 = 50, but nothing is perfect in project management so it's ajusted to 49. |
| The biggest job is planning so almost half of the processes are in Planning | Planning (24 processes) |
| The next biggest job is monitoring. Half of Planning is in Monitoring. | Monitor & Control (12 processes) |
| Executing has a little less than Monitoring. There are two fewer. | Executing (10 processes) |
| Closing is easy. There's only one. | Closing (1 process) |
| Initation has what is left. There's only two. | Initating (2 processes) |
| You can use a phone number to know the number of processes for each knowledge area. (766)436-3734 | Integrate (7), Scope (6), Schedule (6), Cost (4), Quality (3), Resources (6), Communication (3), Risk (7), Procuring (3), Stakeholders (4) |
| Or you can use a mnemonic to remember the numbers. A 76 year old man was married to a 64 year old woman for 36 years. They had 3 kids who were 7 feet, 3 feet, and 4 feet tall. | Integrate (7), Scope (6), Schedule (6), Cost (4), Quality (3), Resources (6), Communication (3), Risk (7), Procuring (3), Stakeholders (4) |

The overall matrix looks like a building with a flat roof. The roof hangs over the walls on both sides. The building has a window in the middle, just under the roof. There is a porch on the left side of the building.

This section has some ways to help remember the cell contents in the Initiation column. There are only two rows that containt text - Integration, Stakeholder.

| Mnemonic | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Do It! | Develop project charter, Identify stakeholders |
